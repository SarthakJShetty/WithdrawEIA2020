# WithdrawEIA2020
This repository contains data, scripts and figures pertaining to environmental clearances (as obtained from the PARIVESH portal hosted by the MOEF&amp;CC)

*Below you will find information copied from this handy resource, the [EIA Toolkit](https://coda.io/d/SAVE-EIA-TOOLKIT_dWwI4b9FeBu/EIA-Toolkit_suyhn#_luB6C)*

## What is EIA? Why is our EIA being diluted ?

To provide short term economic stimulus at the expense of long term  ecological resource depletion the Indian Govt is changing the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) a process/tool of evaluating the likely environmental impacts of a proposed project or development which was created by the World Bank for evaluating new industrial projects in a world of real time climate crisis.  

## Blurb on what’s going on  

*The EIA notification is an important set of guidelines and safeguards for environmental and public welfare. The currently proposed Draft EIA 2020 by the government systematically dilutes these safeguards to favour industrial projects and their ease of doing business. If it came to pass, vast tracts of the country's wilderness will be quickly taken over by corporates, while public and local communities will have very little say in the matter. We live at a time of climate breakdown. The present pandemic has shown us the stark social inequities which exist in our society. The cause of the Covid pandemic is also being strongly linked to rampant loss of habitats, which buffer zoonotic diseases. If the proposed EIA draft came into force, these circumstances in India will worsen far more*

## So what's this repository about?

Well, we decided to obtain the raw data on clearances from [PARIVESH](http://parivesh.nic.in/), a portal hosted by the MOEF&CC. A summary of the analysis will follow. However, all data, figures and scripts emerging from the exploratory data analysis can be obtained here.
